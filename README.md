##Welcome to RIS

Hi everyone, thanks for coming by my tumblr. I'm Ris.

I create lovable charming chibi characters that makes you smile by exclusive requests on Patreon or commission.

If you love cute little chibi characters like I do, you can now immerse yourself into my Chibiverse and enjoy unique aesthetics and adorable personalities of each chibi. And please don't forget to like and leave a  comment (I personally really love to read all of them). And please share, and follow my blog to get all future updates.

Before I go, I just want to let you know that I love you and I genuinely appreciate all of your support. Feel free to leave me a message before checking out. I'm looking forwards to talk to you.

bye,

R
